Functional Requirement: Being able to input a course code and for it to actually show with its details.
  - I would implement a backend service that atleast list out default course regardless of the search terms in the textbox given
Non-Functional Requirement: Being able to filter the courses by alphabetical/course offering times
  - I would implement a sorting algorithm for the courses that do show up after the functional requirement listed above actually works
